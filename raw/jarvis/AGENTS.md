# AGENTS.md

Repo-level instructions for coding agents.

This file is the one instruction file. `CLAUDE.md` only imports it, so write every rule here.
Keep the file short: it is loaded before every task.

## How To Address me

When talking to me - Talk in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English.

## Comments

Be very picky of the comments you write. you are writing way to much comments.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in Linear, team `Jarvis`, through the `linear-server` MCP; PRs live on GitHub. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five default label names: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Multi-context: `CONTEXT-MAP.md` points to one `apps/<app>/docs/CONTEXT.md` per app. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax
